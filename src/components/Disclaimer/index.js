                LinkDao is a decentralized platform that people can use for
                yield farming, staking and enabling users to accumulate their
                crypto assets. Your use of the LinkDao involves various risks,
                including, but not limited to, losses while digital assets are
                being supplied to the Dex's like Uniswap / PancakeSwap and
                losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a liquidity
                pool. Before using the LinkDao, you should review the relevant
                documentation from our Github to make sure you understand how
                the LinkDao works. The LinkDao DeFi project is public,
                open-source or source-available software including a set of
                smart contracts that are deployed currently on the Binance Smart
                Chain.

                Additionally, just as you can access email protocols such as
                SMTP through multiple email clients, you can access the LinkDao
                dApp through dozens of web or mobile interfaces. You are
                responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to
                understand the fees and risks they present.
